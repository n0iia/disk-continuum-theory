# Disk Continuum Theory

A unified metaphysical and quantum-philosophical framework proposing that reality is not pre-recorded or static, but dynamically generated — like data being inscribed on a disk as it spins.  
Each conscious act represents a new write operation in the continuum of existence, forming recursive patterns across perceptual and quantum layers.

## Overview

**Disk Continuum Theory (DCT)** redefines and supersedes the earlier Stylus Theory framework, preserving its generative model of reality while introducing a more precise and technologically aligned metaphor.  

In DCT, reality is not a playback of stored information but a *live-write system* — an ever-spinning disk where the act of perception, decision, and observation continuously generates new sectors of existence.  

This process reflects the recursive nature of consciousness and its entanglement with quantum feedback, suggesting that all perceived time and causality emerge from the dynamic writing of the continuum itself.
