# Stylus Theory

A unified metaphysical and quantum-philosophical framework proposing that reality is not a playback of predetermined events, but a generative inscription—each conscious act cutting new grooves into the substrate of existence.

---

## Overview

**Stylus Theory** explores the idea that consciousness functions as both observer and instrument, actively generating the structure of reality.  
It builds upon principles of quantum feedback, recursive causality, and the **Vestigial Port Model (VPM)** to suggest that existence is dynamically “written” in real time rather than stored and replayed.

This repository serves as the canonical archive of the Stylus Theory whitepaper and related materials.
